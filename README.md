# Geass Translation
## Setup
Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  
Install [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php). For Windows, check "Add application directory to your system path" while installing.  
Download this repository by downloading and extracting it, or cloning it.  
Copy the original Japanese rom into the same folder and rename it as `geass.nds`.  
Run `run_windows.bat` (for Windows) or `run_bash` (for OSX/Linux) to run the tool.  
## Text Editing
Copy the `out_translations\*-ja-JP.xliff` files to `translations\*-en-US.xliff` and edit them through tools like Weblate or POEdit.  
To blank out a line, use a single "!". If just left empty, the line will be left untranslated.  
## Image Editing
Rename the out\_\* folders to work\_\* (out_IMG to work_IMG, etc).  
Edit the images in the work folder(s). The palette on the right should be followed but the repacker will try to approximate other colors to the closest one.  
If an image doesn't require repacking, it should be deleted from the work folder.  
## Run from command line
This is not recommended if you're not familiar with Python and the command line.  
After following the Setup section, run `pipenv sync` to install dependencies.  
Run `pipenv run python tool.py extract` to extract everything, and `pipenv run python tool.py repack` to repack.  
You can use switches like `pipenv run python tool.py repack --bin` to only repack certain parts to speed up the process.
